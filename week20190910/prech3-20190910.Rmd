# The `for` loop in R

## Loop through the sequence 1 to 5 printing the square of each number

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
    print(i)
}
```

## We can capture the results of our loop in a list

Create a vector and then fill in its values

```{r}
vec = rep(NA, 5)
vec

for (i in 1:5) {
    vec[i] = i^2
}
vec
```


## Sum the first 100 squares

```{r}
n = 0
for (i in 1:100) {
    n = n + i^2
}
n

#done with vectors
vec = rep(NA, 100)
for (i in 1:100) {
    vec[i] = i^2
}
sum(vec)
```


## Use a for loop to print the following:

> “The year is 2010”
>
> “The year is 2011”
>
> “The year is 2012”
>
> “The year is 2013”
>
> “The year is 2014”
>
> “The year is 2015”

```{r}
for (i in 2010:2015) {
    cat("The year is ", i, "\n")
}
```
